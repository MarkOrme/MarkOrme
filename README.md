# 👋 Hi, I'm Mark Ormesher  

I've been tinkering with software development, support, and testing since the mid-1990s. Over the years, I’ve had a front-row seat to the incredible evolution of technology—from dial-up modems to the cloud. What keeps me hooked is how software transforms the way we communicate, shop, and play, and I love being part of that transformation.

Back in the day—don’t laugh—I was the go-to person for setting up remote support using Symantec's pcAnywhere and dial-up modems. I’d head onsite, install the software, configure the hardware, and make sure that modem was running at the highest baud rate possible. Why? Because slow modems made remote support feel like watching paint dry.

One day, I learned just how slow ‘slow’ could get. The connection was so painfully sluggish that I realized it would be faster to hop in my car, drive an hour to the client’s site, and fix the issue in person. And guess what? I actually did it. That’s how you troubleshoot at 4800 bps speeds—sometimes you skip the modem and take the highway instead!

## The Three C's  
When it comes to programming, **C**, **C++**, and **C#** are my playgrounds. These languages let me dive deep and build software that’s both functional and complex. Whether it’s automating payroll systems, solving thorny SDK problems, or connecting businesses in high-stakes transactions, I enjoy rolling up my sleeves and creating code that works hard and plays nice.  

## My Journey  
My path into tech has been anything but conventional. It all started with a Programmer/Analyst Diploma from CDI College, where I got my first taste of programming. From there, I dove into night school courses, expanding my understanding of C programming and SQL Server, and learning to write reports with Crystal Reports and develop applications using MS Visual Basic. I also picked up skills in project management with MS Project, gaining insight into waterfall-style project structures. Additionally, I broadened my software development knowledge with an Agile/Scrum Methodology course, which taught me how to bring software ideas to life.

Later, I took the leap into full-time study and earned my Electrical Engineering Degree from the University of British Columbia. That experience not only sharpened my technical skills but also deepened my love for solving complex problems and designing innovative solutions.

Through all these steps, I've built a toolkit that’s as diverse as the projects I’ve tackled—and my love for learning continues to fuel my journey. 

Through it all, I’ve been fortunate to work in roles that challenge and inspire me, from writing code for large-scale systems to helping teams and customers unlock their potential with the right tools and processes. I love learning, teaching, and sharing ideas—and my journey in tech is far from over.  

## What You'll Find Here  
This GitHub is my little corner of the internet for sharing:  
- Projects that tackle real-world challenges,  
- Code experiments where I push my limits, and  
- Notes and resources I’ve picked up along the way.  

## I'm currently learning 🌱
- I've been learning VIM and starting to love the speed of navigation without using the mouse.
- I've been learning more about sorting, hashing, and compression algorithms. Highly recommend [Mastering Algorithms with C by Kyle Loudon](https://g.co/kgs/eWb6rg4)

## I'm currently working on 🔭
I'm in the process of designing a remote-control driveway gate opener. Sure, I could just buy a remote-controlled gate opener off Amazon for about $600, but where’s the fun in that? Instead, I’m taking the DIY route to build one myself. It’s a great opportunity to learn something new, get creative, and hopefully save a bit of money along the way. Stay tuned—this project is just getting started!

## Let’s Connect! 👯  
I’m always open to connecting—whether you want to chat about software, collaborate on a project, or share ideas:
