# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mark Ormesher  

I've been tinkering with software development, support, and testing since the mid-1990s. Over the years, Iâ€™ve had a front-row seat to the incredible evolution of technologyâ€”from dial-up modems to the cloud. What keeps me hooked is how software transforms the way we communicate, shop, and play, and I love being part of that transformation.

Back in the dayâ€”donâ€™t laughâ€”I was the go-to person for setting up remote support using Symantec's pcAnywhere and dial-up modems. Iâ€™d head onsite, install the software, configure the hardware, and make sure that modem was running at the highest baud rate possible. Why? Because slow modems made remote support feel like watching paint dry.

One day, I learned just how slow â€˜slowâ€™ could get. The connection was so painfully sluggish that I realized it would be faster to hop in my car, drive an hour to the clientâ€™s site, and fix the issue in person. And guess what? I actually did it. Thatâ€™s how you troubleshoot at 4800 bps speedsâ€”sometimes you skip the modem and take the highway instead!

## The Three C's  
When it comes to programming, **C**, **C++**, and **C#** are my playgrounds. These languages let me dive deep and build software thatâ€™s both functional and complex. Whether itâ€™s automating payroll systems, solving thorny SDK problems, or connecting businesses in high-stakes transactions, I enjoy rolling up my sleeves and creating code that works hard and plays nice.  

## My Journey  
My path into tech has been anything but boring. I earned my **Electrical Engineering Degree** from the University of British Columbia, where I learned the foundations of problem-solving and systems thinking. Along the way, I added a **Programmer/Analyst Diploma**, a **CAPM Diploma**, and a **Project Management Certificate** to my toolkit. These arenâ€™t just lines on a rÃ©sumÃ©â€”they represent the experiences that shaped how I approach problems, collaborate with teams, and deliver results.  

Through it all, Iâ€™ve been fortunate to work in roles that challenge and inspire me, from writing code for large-scale systems to helping teams and customers unlock their potential with the right tools and processes. I love learning, teaching, and sharing ideasâ€”and my journey in tech is far from over.  

## What You'll Find Here  
This GitHub is my little corner of the internet for sharing:  
- Projects that tackle real-world challenges,  
- Code experiments where I push my limits, and  
- Notes and resources Iâ€™ve picked up along the way.  

## I'm currently learning ðŸŒ±
- I've been learning VIM and starting to love the speed of navigation without using the mouse.
- I've been learning more about sorting, hashing, and compression algorithms. Highly recommend [Mastering Algorithms with C by Kyle Loudon](https://g.co/kgs/eWb6rg4)

## I'm currently working on ðŸ”­
I'm in the process of designing a remote-control driveway gate opener. Sure, I could just buy a remote-controlled gate opener off Amazon for about $600, but whereâ€™s the fun in that? Instead, Iâ€™m taking the DIY route to build one myself. Itâ€™s a great opportunity to learn something new, get creative, and hopefully save a bit of money along the way. Stay tunedâ€”this project is just getting started!

## Letâ€™s Connect! ðŸ‘¯  
Iâ€™m always open to connectingâ€”whether you want to chat about software, collaborate on a project, or share ideas:  
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-ormesher)   

Thanks for dropping by. Hereâ€™s to building, learning, and having fun! ðŸš€
